# What the Keystone - World of Warcraft Addon Source

Keep forgetting which key you've just been invited to, when applying to a ton of Mythic Plus keys? No longer. What the Keystone remembers for you and reminds you whenever you want.

Upon joining a group, What the Keystone prints the joined Keystone + Level in the chat. You can either always scroll back to the chat message or type `/wtk` or `/whatthekeystone` in the chat to get another reminder which keystone you've been invited to.

The chat message is only visible to you.

### Chat Commands

`/wtk` or `/whatthekeystone` to print the LFG keystone to the chat.
